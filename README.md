# Final Project - JavaScript Tips
## This is my final project for PROJ202

This site was made for the PROJ202 class! It was to create your own project from scratch!
I decided on a site that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also includes GitHub too.
I put my blood, sweat, and tears into this. Enjoy!
