    <h2>The let Variable</h2>
    <p>The <strong>let</strong> keyword is used to declare variables that are block-scoped, meaning that they
    are only accessible within the block of code in which they are defined. <strong>let</strong> is similar
    to <strong>var</strong>, but it is subject to the rules of block scoping, whereas var is function-scoped.</p>
    <button type="button" class="button">let Example</button>

      <h2>The const Variable</h2>
      <p>The <strong>const</strong> keyword is used to declare variables that are read-only, meaning that they
      cannot be reassigned after they are declared. This makes <strong>const</strong> a useful tool for
      preventing unintended changes to variables in your code.</p>
